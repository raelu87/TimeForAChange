						<h4>WHAT IS SCHOOL BULLYING?</h4>
						<p>School bullying refers to a single or multiple deliberate or malicious act of bullying or insulting by one
							party of students (an individual or a group) inside and outside the campus through physical, language and
							Internet means, causing physical and psychological injury, property loss or mental damage to the other party
							(individual or group).

						<h4>HOW DOES BULLYING AFFECT PEOPLE?</h4>
						<p>Bullying affects young people in many different ways. It can impact on their self-esteem, emotional wellbeing,
							education and life outside of school. Young people experiencing bullying may feel that they aren’t worth help or
							that nobody likes them. They may feel self-conscious or embarrassed lots of the time. They may also feel scared,
							sad or overwhelmed, and find it difficult to sleep or eat. Many young people who have been bullied find it
							really hard to ever feel safe or confident in anything they do, leading them to isolate ourselves from others
							and to give up the things they enjoy doing.

					Whatever form bullying takes, being bullied can have a huge impact on a young person’s life, impacting on their
					self-esteem and mental health. Sometimes someone may try to justify their behaviour by finding something different
					about the person they are bullying – this might include what they look like, how they express themselves or what
					they do. But this does not mean that the person being bullied is to blame. There is never any justification for
					bullying.
